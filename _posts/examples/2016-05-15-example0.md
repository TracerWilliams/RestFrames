Examples are now appearing in **RestFrames**. The collection of
examples available can be found in the `RestFrames/examples`
folder. After [downloading]({{ site.url }}/downloads/) and installing
**RestFrames** examples can be run from the ROOT command line

	root [0] .x examples/example_#.C++

Alternatively, examples executables can be run as binary executables

	>$ ./examples/example_#.x

Each example creates an output file `output_example_#.root` containing
decay trees and figures.
